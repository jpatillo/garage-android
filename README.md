 Android app for the Garage project.

The android app is very simple. It allows user sign in, and has a button to activate the garage door.

Currently, the first time the app is run, tapping the image icon will start the sign in process. There is no display of the temperature and humidity yet. The device is reporting it, but the server is not saving it.

# TODO

- Implement add device
- Theme and assets
